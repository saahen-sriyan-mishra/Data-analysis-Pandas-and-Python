## Zomato DataSet Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Introduction
This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset, a rich repository of information regarding restaurants and dining experiences. Through this analysis, we aim to extract actionable insights and uncover meaningful patterns that can inform decision-making processes within the food industry.

### Dataset Overview
The Zomato dataset comprises various attributes related to restaurants, including their names, locations, cuisines offered, average ratings, user reviews, and more. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `zomato.csv`.

### Analysis Objectives
1. **Data Understanding**: Gain insights into the structure and content of the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the numerical and categorical variables, explore relationships between features, and visualize key trends.
4. **Insights Generation**: Draw actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Import necessary libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
   - Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing values using appropriate techniques.
   - Ensure data consistency and accuracy.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Explore numerical variables through descriptive statistics.
   - Analyze categorical variables and their distributions.
   - Investigate relationships between features using visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots.

4. **Insights Generation**:
   - Draw actionable insights from the analysis, focusing on key trends and patterns.
   - Provide recommendations for stakeholders in the food industry based on the findings.

### Key Findings
1. **Rating Distribution**: The majority of restaurants fall within the rating range of 2.5 to 3.4.
2. **Online Delivery Availability**: Online delivery options are prevalent in India and UAE, indicating potential market opportunities.
3. **Customer Preferences**: Indian customers contribute significantly to zero ratings, suggesting potential areas for improvement in service quality.
